Create a single-slide high-level architecture design in Gamma App for an end-to-end cloud migration plan of an Agentic AI web application, built with Java and Spring Boot, automating Java app migrations from on-premises to cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) or cross-cloud, extensible for Python/Node.js. Consolidate the following 10-slide presentation into one slide, integrating all content, visuals, and key points into a unified, visually appealing radial diagram targeting SMEs. Include a simplified flowchart (5–7 nodes) within the diagram, showing the five phases (Discovery: folder path analysis, Planning: strategy selection, Preparation: resource provisioning, Execution: app/data migration, Validation: testing/optimization), benefits (AI automation, multi-cloud, SME-friendly), extensibility (Python, Node.js, reinforcement learning), and CTA (free tier for 3 apps). Use a modern tech theme with Blue (#0052CC), White (#FFFFFF), Orange (#F28C38) colors; Montserrat Bold (24pt title, 16pt subtitles) and Open Sans Regular (10–12pt body) fonts; and Gamma-compatible visuals (cloud, AI brain, folder, Java/Python/Node.js icons, gears, rocket, shield). Output as a JSON-like text description with title, content, visuals, layout, colors, fonts, and Gamma notes, ensuring clarity, no clutter, and a professional layout with a white background and faint cloud overlay (20% opacity).
