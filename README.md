Create a single-slide architecture design in Canva that consolidates a 10-slide presentation into a comprehensive overview of an end-to-end cloud migration plan for an Agentic AI web application. The application, built with Java and Spring Boot, automates the migration of Java applications from on-premises to cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) or between clouds, with extensibility for other tech stacks (e.g., Python, Node.js). The slide must integrate the content, visuals, and key points from the following 10 slides, provided as JSON, into a unified, visually appealing architecture diagram. The target audience is SMEs lacking cloud expertise, and the slide should highlight the application’s AI-driven automation, multi-cloud support, and SME-friendly design. Provide the output as a detailed text description of the slide (title, content, visuals, layout, colors, fonts) that can be implemented in Canva, ensuring clarity and professionalism.

### Single-Slide Design Requirements

**Objective**: Combine all 10 slides into a single architecture diagram that visually represents the end-to-end cloud migration plan, including the five phases (Discovery and Assessment, Migration Planning, Pre-Migration Preparation, Migration Execution, Post-Migration Validation and Optimization), the complete migration flow, key benefits, extensibility, and a call to action. The slide should be clear, professional, and suitable for presenting to SMEs.

**General Styling**:
- **Theme**: Modern, tech-focused, professional.
- **Colors**: Primary: Blue (#0052CC), Secondary: White (#FFFFFF), Accent: Orange (#F28C38).
- **Fonts**: Title: Montserrat Bold, Body: Open Sans Regular, Font sizes: Title (24pt), Subtitles (16pt), Body (12pt).
- **Layout**: Circular or radial architecture diagram centered on the slide, with sections for each phase and supporting elements (benefits, extensibility, CTA) around the edges.
- **Visuals**: Use Canva’s icons (cloud, folder, AI brain, Java/Python/Node.js logos, gears, rocket, shield, graph), a simplified flowchart, and a subtle cloud network background.
- **Background**: White with a faint cloud network overlay (opacity 20%) to maintain focus on the diagram.

**Slide Content and Structure**:
1. **Title and Tagline (Slide 1)**:
   - Place at the top center: “End-to-End Cloud Migration with Agentic AI” (24pt, Montserrat Bold, White on Blue banner).
   - Tagline below: “AI-Driven, Multi-Cloud, SME-Friendly” (14pt, Open Sans Regular, Orange).
   - Logo placeholder: Small rectangle (80x80px) top-right.

2. **Key Benefits (Slide 2)**:
   - Position in a small box top-left (150x100px).
   - Content: “Why Choose Us? AI Automation, Multi-Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP), SME-Friendly” (12pt, Blue).
   - Visual: Small AI brain and cloud icons (20x20px, Orange).

3. **Migration Phases (Slide 3)**:
   - Represent as five interconnected circular nodes in the center, forming a radial diagram.
   - Each node labeled with a phase (e.g., “Discovery,” “Planning”) and an icon (magnifying glass, plan, gears, rocket, shield; 30x30px, Orange).
   - Connect nodes with Blue arrows to show flow.

4–7. **Phase Details (Slides 4–7)**:
   - Attach a small rectangular box (120x80px) to each phase node, summarizing key actions and outputs.
   - **Discovery (Slide 4)**: “Input: Folder Path, Parse Build Files, Recommend Cloud” with folder and cloud icons.
   - **Planning (Slide 5)**: “Select Strategy (Rehost, Replatform), Map Resources” with checklist icon.
   - **Preparation & Execution (Slide 6)**: “Provision Resources, Deploy App, Migrate Data” with gears and rocket icons.
   - **Validation (Slide 7)**: “Test Functionality, Optimize Costs, Secure” with graph and shield icons.
   - Use 10pt text, Blue, with Orange icon accents.

8. **Complete Migration Flow (Slide 8)**:
   - Embed a simplified flowchart within the radial diagram, connecting the phase nodes.
   - Flow: “Folder Path → Analysis (Java Build Files) → Plan → Deploy → Validate” with boxes (processes), diamonds (decisions), and cloud icons (DBs).
   - Add a dashed box bottom-center labeled “Future Tech Stacks” with Python/Node.js icons (20x20px, Orange).
   - Use Blue lines for flow, Orange for decisions.

9. **Extensibility (Slide 9)**:
   - Place in a small box bottom-left (150x100px).
   - Content: “Extensible: Java (Maven, Gradle, Ant), Future: Python, Node.js, AI: Reinforcement Learning” (12pt, Blue).
   - Visual: Java, Python, Node.js, AI brain icons (20x20px, Orange).

10. **Call to Action (Slide 10)**:
    - Position in a box bottom-right (150x100px).
    - Content: “Migrate with Confidence! Free Tier: 3 Apps, Contact: [website], [email]” (12pt, White on Orange).
    - Visual: CTA button (“Start Now,” 80x30px, Blue) and small cloud dashboard image (50x50px).

**Layout**:
- **Center**: Radial diagram with five phase nodes (100x100px each) arranged in a pentagon, connected by Blue arrows. Each node has a phase icon and a small attached box for details.
- **Top**: Title and tagline in a Blue banner (600x80px), logo placeholder top-right.
- **Top-Left**: Benefits box (150x100px).
- **Bottom-Left**: Extensibility box (150x100px).
- **Bottom-Right**: CTA box (150x100px).
- **Background**: White with faint cloud network overlay (search “cloud network” in Canva, set opacity to 20%).

**Visuals**:
- Search Canva’s library for: “cloud icon,” “AI brain,” “folder,” “magnifying glass,” “checklist,” “gears,” “rocket,” “shield,” “graph,” “Java logo,” “Python logo,” “Node.js logo.”
- Use a simplified flowchart within the radial diagram, with 5–7 nodes to avoid clutter.
- Add a small cloud dashboard image for the CTA box (search “cloud dashboard”).

**Canva Implementation Notes**:
- Use Canva’s “Shapes” for circular phase nodes and arrows.
- Create the flowchart with Canva’s “Lines & Shapes” or flowchart elements.
- Apply a subtle “Fade” animation to the radial diagram and boxes.
- Ensure text is legible (minimum 10pt) and icons are consistently sized.
- Use Canva’s alignment tools to balance the layout and avoid overcrowding.

**Output Format**:
Provide the response as a JSON-like structure describing the single slide:
```json
{
  "title": "End-to-End Cloud Migration with Agentic AI",
  "content": "...",
  "visuals": "...",
  "layout": "...",
